## Dataset 

We have prepared the relevant processed datasets, which can be used directly for your convenience. Please download the pretraining, fine-tuning, and transfer datasets used in the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15473642).

Once you have successfully downloaded the datasets, please follow these steps for organization:

#### Pretraining Datasets: 

Extract the pre-training dataset and unzip it under the `./dataset/pretrained` folder. Additionally, we have provided a pre-training debug dataset to assist you in debugging your code.

#### Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning Datasets:

Extract the fine-tuning and transfer learning datasets and unzip them under the `./dataset/fine-tuning` folder.
